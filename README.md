# kNN: k Nearest Neighbors
**************************
Input:      inX: vector to compare to existing dataset (1xN)
            dataSet: size m data set of known vectors (NxM)
            labels: data set labels (1xM vector)
            k: number of neighbors to use for comparison (should be an odd number)
            
Output:     the most popular class label

# SVM : support vector machine
